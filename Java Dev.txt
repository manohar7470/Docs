Object class in Java?
?
PTR4 : BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to scanner because scanner does parsing of input data and BufferedReader simply reads sequence of characters.

Interface - is a contract and any class that implement that interface it become compulsory for that class to implement the methods that are defined in that interface.
            An interface is a method that does not have bodies(we just define function).An interface only has abstract methods.
			public interface className{}, public classAName implement ClassB{}
Abstract class-  It can only be extended , u can't create instance of it.It only meant to be parent of other class.
               - u can use it like AbstractClass a= new childClass(); in child class and only call with this abstract method only not other method of child class.

PTR 1 - A class can only inherit one class but it can implement more than one interface
PTR 2-Some implementations allow null key and null values like the HashMap and LinkedHashMap, but some do not like the TreeMap.
      there should be only one null key object and there can be any number of null values.
PTR 3 - n Java, types with generic type parameters, such as HashMap, only accept types that inherit from Object. long does not inherit from Object, so you can't use it with HashMap. You can however use Long, which is a boxed version of long. (HashMap<Long,Long>m = new HashMap<>())is correct
PTR 4 - String s= 5+"";-(s will be treated as string and it work as expected) But ->String s=5 (will throw error as 5 is not a string)

 === Java HashMap method map.put(a1[i],map.getOrDefault(a1[i],0)+1);~similar to~ m[a[i]]++ of c++. check map.getOrDefault(key, value) method==> see this problem in java  https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-subset-of-another-array2317/1?page=1&curated[]=1&sortBy=submissions
		        char a[] = S1.toCharArray();char b[] = S2.toCharArray();Arrays.sort(a);Arrays.sort(b);Boolean result = Arrays.equals(a,b);if(result==true){return 1;
 Arrays.sort(str1);Collections.sort(arrList);
Arrays.sort() uses Dual-Pivot Quicksort for Primitive Arrays and MergeSort for sorting array of Objects.Collection.sort is used when you dealing with lists and arrays.sort is sued when dealing with arrays.
